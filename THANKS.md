# MailPolicyExplainer Thanks

I'd like to offer some special thanks to a few people for contributing their time, ideas, and bug reports to the development of this module.  Without the following people, this module would be worse than it is.

-[Jason Berry](https://github.com/skyblaster), a so-called fried of the module, for submitting many bug reports and pull requests, and giving me plenty to think about.
- Chris Andrew, my counterpart at work and my favorite beta tester, who's run this module through its paces -- or so he thinks!  Just wait until we start working with MTA-STS and DANE!  I know you're wondering what the additional red text means.
